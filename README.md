# Coronavirus_Tweet_Sentiment_Analysis
In this project we are going to analyize the tweets to determine there sentiments, Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorising opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writerâ€™s attitude towards a particular topic, i.e., positive, negative, or neutral, is expressed in the piece of text. The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done. 
A large dataset is provided in this supervised classification machine learning project. We are given information like Location, Tweet At, Original Tweet, and Sentiment. The given challenge is to build a classification model to predict the sentiment of Covid-19 tweets
